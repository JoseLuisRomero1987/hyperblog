I was born in April 1987 in Mexico. Since I remember, I developed a passion for mathematics and its application to medicine. When I was 15 I studied electrical control, then in the college (UPIITA) I studied bionics engineering, both at the IPN. 
From then on, I looked for apply my knowledge in the healthcare industry, nevertheless; the commercial market in Mexico for that industry is just for importation and maintenance. 

My work experience has been interdisciplinary:
2 years as a supervisor in electronics and instrumentation in the glass industry in which I maintained image processing machines to evaluate the quality of the bottles, temperature controls, speed controls, as well as PLC programming, among other activities.

3 years as a solutions architect, where I developed image processing and computer vision software for different technologies (android, .net, java, python, etc).

2 years as an RPA developer where I integrated web development, .net monitors, SQL queries, etc. to build the robot path under rule-based and high-efficiency processes.

My work experience has made me get mature and understand that linking different knowledge areas until reaching a industrial production must be in the establishment of solid foundations of research, which motivated me to study a master's degree in the research line "processing of dynamic systems". I focused my research on the measurement of synchrony in electroencephalographic signals of children with epilepsy. The basis of my research was supported by non-linear dynamics and complex networks.
Nowadays, my goals are oriented to apply the syncrony assesment of EGG to predict voluntary motions patterns using deep learning and machine learning.
